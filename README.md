# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

A machine learning project to predict heart disease using multiple classifiers and compare their performance.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File:** `heart.xlsx`
- Contains medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc., used to predict the presence of heart disease.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Perform KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree classifiers to predict heart disease based on the attached dataset.  
Also perform a comparative study among the models to evaluate which performs best.

## ✏️ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier
- Implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
- Implementing Decision Tree classifier
- Comparing model accuracies and visualizing results

## 📁 Files
- `heart.svmm.ipynb` — the main notebook containing code, visualizations, and analysis
- `heart.xlsx` — dataset used for training and evaluation
